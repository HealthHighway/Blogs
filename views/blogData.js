    heading: "5 reasons to choose Yoga over Gym",
    subheading: "Yoga is Fun if done",
    discription: `Recently you had an alarming revelation when you saw the number on your weighing machine when you were taking your weight. Or you just found out that your favourite dress no longer fits you. You need to do something about your health, how about joining a gym to work out? But have you heard about its much older cousin - Yoga. You will be surprised by the numerous benefits it offers.</span></p>
      <p>Yoga or Gym is a question that boggles every new fitness enthusiast. Both follow different styles and approaches towards fitness. Gym sessions focus on rigorous exercise directed towards muscle building and burning calories, while Yoga is the complete package for physical and psychological wellness. Here are some reasons that will prove that Yoga is much better - especially if you have just started focusing on your body fitness. </p> `,
    discription2: ` <p>Firstly, Yoga routines are much simpler and convenient, making them much easier to follow when you are getting used to a new daily routine. You don't need any fancy equipment to practice Yoga - a simple yoga mat or a relatively clean floor is all you need to start practicing different asanas. There is no need to go anywhere and, the whole routine will be over in no time. So there are no excuses for skipping a day.</p><br>
    <p>Secondly, Yoga routines refresh your body rather than exhaust it. For regular gym-goers, muscle sores, aches, and injuries are part of the routine. They will even justify the sores by telling you no pain- no gain. Yoga is conducted at a much slower pace and works the muscles out gently. So there is a lot of 'gain' and absolutely 'no pain' (Brilliant isn't it?).</p><br>
    <p>Thirdly, Yoga benefits the body both internally as well as externally. Stretching and bending different muscles boosts the circulatory system, lymph nodes, and many more body systems. Thus, Yoga not only benefits your external body and muscles but also takes care of your internal organs.</p><br>
    <p>Fourthly, Yoga also takes care of your mental fitness. Going to the Gym can be very stressful with all the strain your body goes through to burn fat and build muscle. Yoga exercises instead relieve your muscles and reduce stress levels. People who practice Yoga regularly often lead more peaceful lives. Reduced stress and anxiety improves your concentration thus, benefiting your health as a whole.</p><br>
    <p>Finally, Yoga benefits last much longer. Yoga routines don't aim to reduce your weight quickly or provide you instant results. That's the aim of rigorous Gym workouts which, can cause immense strain on your body. More seriously, it can lead to dangerous withdrawal symptoms or cravings. Most people often stop going to the Gym when they feel they have achieved their "superficial" body, and not surprisingly, their body returns to its unfit self after few weeks. With Yoga, however, it is different. Most people don't see it as a burden and find it much easier to follow it regularly and make it a part of their daily routine.</p><br>
    <p>In the end, Yoga is much more than a workout to give you a physical look. It is a more mature way of approaching your fitness. And it can be just as challenging and exciting as spending an hour at the Gym. While both practices are good in their ways, heading off to the Gym can feel like a task, Yoga, however, will feel like you're giving yourself a treat. </p><br>

    discription: `“Yoga does not make your life better. It makes you better at life.”
    That pretty much sums up the purpose of Yoga in our life. One starts the journey of Yoga with pain, and then eventually ends up gaining strength, flexibility and stillness. Yoga helps the restless soul come to peace and brings back calm and mindfulness to one's busy life. </p>
    <p>Today everyone is celebrating 7th International Yoga Day across different cultures and locations in the entire world to reconnect with their inner self and be at peace with the mind and the body. To keep up with a fast-paced life and make our future better, we forget to stay in the present and take care of our health. So, this Yoga Day, let's come up with a resolution of not compromising our health, kyuki jaan hai toh jahaan hai.</p>
    `,
    discription2: ` <p style="font-weight: bold;" >What is Yoga and Why do we celebrate it?</p>
    <p>Yoga is a physical and spiritual activity that originated in India. The word ‘Yoga’ derives from Sanskrit which means to unite i.e., the unison of mind and body. It helps in maintaining the overall development of one’s physical as well as mental well-being. The idea to celebrate Yoga annually was presented by the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, in his UN address in 2014. The celebration aims to raise awareness about the health benefits of practicing Yoga across the globe. </p><br>
    <p>To recognize how Yoga plays an important role in our daily lives, this year’s theme for International Yoga Day by UN is <span style="font-style: italic" >Yoga for well-being.</span></p><br>
    <p>We all know, 2020 was a challenging year for everyone in all aspects, physically and mentally. The pandemic made all of us anxious and miserable. During the period, many people suffered from mental health problems, like depression and anxiety. So, this year’s theme promotes the message to practice Yoga for a fresh and healthy lifestyle holistically. Many people embraced Yoga and it helped them to be focused and patient during times of uncertainty. Yoga has also played a significant role in the rehabilitation of Covid-19 patients in quarantine or isolation, especially with their anxiety. </p><br>
    <p>In the past few years, physical inactivity has increased which has become one of the major factors for the rise in Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, cancer, heart disease, obesity, etc. According to <a style="color:#4CA9EE" href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/noncommunicable-diseases#tab=tab_1" >WHO</a>, 70% of the deaths worldwide are due to NCDs. Therefore, for the prevention of NCDs and their risk factors, organizations like UN, WHO, UNICEF are promoting Yoga to encourage people for regular practice as it incorporates breath control and meditation that improves immunity and strengthens the body.  </p><br>
    <p>The youngsters find Yoga to be boring and not cool because their focus is on the looks, building muscular body and 6-pack abs. But the reality is that they have little knowledge of Yoga and it's benefits. And trust me on this one, Yoga is the new cool. So, it’s your choice, what do you want to be : <span style="font-style: italic" >fool or cool ?</span></p><br>

    subheading: "Choose Gain over your Back Pain!",
    discription: `Back pain has been one of the most common reasons, especially in India, to visit a doctor. Back pain usually arises when an individual is suffering from Arthritis or Osteoporosis. Also, in extremely common cases, back bain pain is usually a result of poor physical posture. It might even be the result of the repeated heavy lifting (gym, much? Stop) or disk disease. <span style="color:#4CA9EE" >Indian Journal of Pain</span> recently brought out a graph where it stated that - "The occurrence of lower back pain in <span style="font-weight: bold;">India</span> is alarming with nearly 60% of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">people in India suffering</span> from lower <span style="font-weight: bold;">back pain</span> at some point of time in their lifespan." <span style="font-weight: bold;" >
    It is notably alarming as young adults ranging from 16-20 years of age make up 20% of the total population who go for back pain treatment.</span></p>
    `,
    discription2: `<p>Are you worried about what can be a remedy for back pain? Can rest be one? (NO. It can rather worsen it, rather). The most effective treatment for back pain is yoga. Yoga can greatly be effective in reducing back pain and in maintaining a robust spine. Yoga can stretch as well as increase and improve important back muscles. It can bring remarkable improvement in body alignment, so that body can become flexible. To burst your myth, yoga isn't just about turning and bending your body, it is about achieving a proper balance in body posture.  In fact, a study on the effect of Iyengar yoga (a type of yoga) therapy for chronic low back pain showed that patients experienced less back pain after doing Iyengar yoga for at least an hour and a half, every week for 16 weeks and at-home practice for 30 minutes 5 days a week.</p><br>
    <p>Moreover and, in simple words, back pain can eff you up. All you need is a partner in crime who is going through the same condition in their life too. A partner in crime who is compassionate, caring and kind enough towards your unstable state of mind and health. </p><br>
    <p>What if I tell you that you can combine the benefits of yoga, as well as find yourself a friend, all while taking care of yourself? YES (*drum rolls again*), <span style="font-weight: bold;">WE WELCOME YOU TO HEALTH HIGHWAY.</span></p><br>

    heading: "5 Reasons For Children To Follow Yoga",
    subheading: "Yoga: A Journey from Pain to Gain",
    discription: ` With rising competition and busy parents in a fast-paced world, children might encounter social, emotional and physical challenges which can take a toll on their health. When children practice Yoga at an early age, they learn techniques for relaxation and mindfulness which encourages healthy lifestyle. Yoga brings patience and stillness which helps in better management of the life situations. It not only encourages mental wellness but also the physical strength. </p>
    <p>Yoga helps the children connect with themselves and the nature that surrounds them. As the early yogis were close to nature, the yoga asanas were influenced by the animals around. For instance, Bhujangasana (Cobra pose) strengthens the spine and it makes one feel like a snake having long spine with no arms and legs. Similarly, Simhasana (Lion Pose) helps release stress and stretches facial muscles. It also makes one feel powerful like a lion meanwhile teaching them to express themselves. And the list goes on …</p>
    `,
    discription2: `<p style="font-weight: bold;" >Yoga improves the overall well-being. And here are the main 5 reasons for the children to follow Yoga: </p><br>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold" >1. Improves Concentration Level</span> – Practicing Yoga asanas daily helps the children to focus on achieving the particular pose and maintain the balance. As a result, this practice becomes a habit and comes to regulation in other aspects of life as well, like education, sports, etc. This leads them to concentrate well while studying, resulting in better academic performances. For instance, breathing exercises brings their notice to every breath, helping to increase the concentration level. <span style="font-weight: bold;" >Stay in Present!</span></p><br>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold" >2. Boosts Self-Esteem and Confidence</span> – With competitiveness around and the added social pressures, children tend to lose confidence in themselves and experiencing anxiety, fear, and other uncomfortable symptoms. Yoga teaches them to be patient and work towards the goal. Mastering a pose gives them confidence and a sense of self-worth. Daily practice encourages self-esteem and help them regain the faith in their capabilities. <span style="font-weight: bold;" >Trust yourself! : )</span></p><br>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold" >3. Enhances Strength and Flexibility</span> – Yoga is a spiritual activity and a physical exercise as well. It strengthens the muscles, making the body flexible and feel less tired. The child becomes aware of the body and its functions while stretching various muscles. This not only improves physical fitness but also benefits the mental well-being indirectly by bringing awareness to both mind and body. The awareness technique promotes holistic wellness by helping in different aspects of life. <span style="font-weight: bold;" >Be fit, Be strong! </span></p><br>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold" >4. Sound Sleep</span> – Maintaining Sleep Hygiene is very important. It is the term used to describe good sleep habits. <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/research/wellness-related-use-of-common-complementary-health-approaches-among-adults-united-states-2012" style="color:#4CA9EE" target="_blank" >A national survey</a> in U.S. stated that over 55% of people who did yoga experienced better sleep and over 85% said yoga helped reduce stress. Considerate research is done and it suggests that good sleeping habits help in dealing with stress. Inadequate sleep affects one’s productivity levels, resulting in low concentration levels. Yoga promotes longer and quality sleep, thereby increasing energy levels. <span style="font-weight: bold;" >Sleep right and tight! </span></p><br>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold" >5. Refines Balance and Coordination</span> – Balancing is one of the key elements of Yoga. It teaches the child to be stable and calm while handling a difficult situation. The physical balance from a particular pose gives them a sense of accomplishment and they also learn to coordinate their body with their mind. This promotes the overall growth and development. <span style="font-weight: bold;" >Live a balanced life!</span></p><br>
    <p>Yoga is beneficial to the children of all ages. So, let’s be more responsible towards the future of our country and guide them towards a healthy lifestyle. Health Highway aims to provide holistic wellness through Yoga with our professional instructors and dieticians with a belief in healthy lifestyle.

   Play the Meno-'Pause' Button!\n
        Have you been experiencing mood shifts and weight gain? Constantly being cranky or just being too emotional to any criticism being thrown at you? As it is a biological process, Menopause is caused when the ovaries start to secrete less of both oestrogen and progesterone  - the female hormones - and can trigger a myriad of bothersome symptoms. Hence, this might be the reason behind your anxiety or irritability. Insomnia is a common problem too. Are you too worried about your sudden weight gain? Irregular sleep patterns and age-related restrictions in gaining metabolism can be the reason behind it. </p>
        <p>BUT, (*drum rolls*) what if I tell you that you can find yourself peace and calm and find a place to relax your senses? Yes, I think you got the hint - it is Yoga. Many women have found that yoga, including therapeutic and supportive poses, can enhance the annoying and undesirable side effects of menopause, including hot flashes, insomnia, anxiety and other problems. Yoga also in controlling hormonal imbalances. Asanas such as Uttanasana (Standing Forward Bend), Prasarita Padottanasana (Wide-Legged Standing Forward Bend) can help reduce the annoyance and deteriorating mental health. Other asanas such as Supta Baddha Konasana and Sarvangasana can be beneficial too.</p>
        <p>Moreover and, in simple words, Menopause can be the b-word sometimes. All you need is a partner in crime who is going through the same condition in her life too. A partner in crime who is compassionate, caring and kind enough towards your unstable state of mind and health. </p><br>
